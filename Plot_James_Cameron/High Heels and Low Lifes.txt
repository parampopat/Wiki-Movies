The film follows the story of two women living in London, Shannon (Minnie Driver) and Frances (Mary McCormack), attempting to con a group of gangsters, led by Kerrigan (Michael Gambon) and Mason (Kevin McNally), into giving them Â£1,000,000 after they overhear a conversation between gang members during a local bank heist. The idea is that the money will later be used to purchase a large amount of expensive medical equipment for the hospital where Shannon works as an overworked and underpaid nurse. Frances, a failing American actress who has resorted to doing voice acting for children's cartoons, wants the money so that she can get out of the rut she believes she is stuck in, and also because she wants a Mercedes to replace her aging Pontiac Firebird.Throughout the course of the film, the women threaten the mobsters in order to persuade them to give them a cut of the heist money. As the film progresses, the danger the women are in becomes more obvious, and just as it appears that they are out of their depth - Frances' car is blown up and Shannon is almost kidnapped - they successfully break into Mason's house and confront him and one of his gang. A mass shoot-out occurs after it becomes clear that the girls have stolen all of Mason's guns and have bagged all the money. They manage to get away in the gang members' Porsche Boxster with the bags of money. The hospital equipment is delivered to Shannon's hospital anonymously, as Shannon and Frances look on. They then drive off into London in the Mercedes CLK that they have bought with some of the money, happy that they have done the right thing.
